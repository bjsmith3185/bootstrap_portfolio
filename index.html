                    <p>My name is Brian J Smith. I was born in Chapel Hill North Carolina but grew up in Albemarle, just about one hour east of Charlotte. I graduated from Albemarle High School in 1993.</p>
                
                    <p>I attended Stanly Community College after high school where I received an Associate's degree in Drafting and Design Engineering. I then enrolled at UNCC and completed the Bachelor's degree program in Manufacturing Engineering.</p>
                
                    <p>I worked a few engineering type positions for a few years before taking a position with the City of Charlotte. While working for the City of Charlotte, I studied at Pfeiffer University and received my Master's in Business Administration.</p>
                
                    <p>I have always had an interest in how things are put together and operate. I am excited to take my career in a new direction with UNCC's Coding and Web Development Bootcamp! I began this program in March 2018 and will graduate in August the same year. I look forward to interviewing with companies in hopes of finding my perfect fit in the web development field!</p>
